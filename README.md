ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project on Electric Vehicle (EV) data analysis! ðŸš—âš¡

I recently completed ðŸ™Œ my another project at Innomatics Research Labs on Data Analysis on Electric Vehicle (EV) âš¡ðŸš— . I had been given a dataset, on which I did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where I analyzed and visualized the given data. 

I was assigned 3 tasks during the project:

Task 1: To Apply Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate) on the dataset given.

Task 2: To Create a Choropleth using plotly.express to display the number of EV vehicles based on location.

Task 3: To Create a Racing Bar Plot to display the animation of EV Make and its count each year.

âœ¨Key Insights of the Project:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed EDA on the data to get Univariate and Bivariate analyses of key trends in EV like Model, Model Year, Make and much more.

Choropleth Map Visualization: I created a Choropleth Map using Plotly  to visualize the EV count across different geographical locations of Washington, USA.

Racing Bar Plot Animation: I created an animated Racing Bar Plot to track the growth of different EV manufacturers over the period years. The dynamic bars indicates the rise of EV Makers.
